# Valiant Template: Desktop/Mobile app using Blazor Hybrid with MAUI and/or Photino

This is a very simple template for a desktop and mobile app that uses Blazor Hybrid with MAUI and/or Photino.

This is not an enterprise-ready template; rather, it's a simple example that I use to show my teach-savvy friends and colleagues how to set up a simple desktop and/or mobile app that uses Blazor Hybrid.
